abstract={Despite decades of research, it is unclear under which circumstances travel is most onerous. While studies have found that some individuals derive positive utility from aspects of commuting, others have shown that traffic congestion can entail important time, monetary, and mental stress costs. Moreover, responses to traffic congestion-related stressors differs by individual characteristics. In response, this research captures how exposure to traffic congestion events, the duration of this exposure, and individual trait susceptibility to congestion affect the utility of commuting. Working through the lens of individual satisfaction with the duration of their commute, we show that not every minute of travel is valued the same by car commuters in Canadian cities. Results suggest a complex relationship between travel time, congestion, and individual predisposition to congestion-related stress. While improvements in travel time matter for increasing commute satisfaction, it is reductions in travel in congested conditions that matter most, particularly among those susceptible to congestion-related stressors.},

 abstract = {The commute impedance model (e.g. Stokols, Novaco, Stokols and Campbell, 1978) is evaluated through a literature review and a survey of commuters who drive to work (N = 418). A new construct for the study of commuting-commute variability-is introduced and tested in the framework of the survey. Findings from the literature review indicated (a) partial support for the first proposition of the impedance model namely, that impedance-measured as commute distance or time-causes strain (e.g. employee health deficits), but (b) no support for the second proposition of the model namely, that the impedance-strain is moderated by control or the availability of choice. Similarly, the survey showed that (a) commute length (impedance) is consistently correlated with strain, (b) choice is weakly and negatively related to strain, but (c) there is no interactive relationship of choice and length with strain. Furthermore, the results suggest that (a) commute variability is the strongest correlate of commute strain, and that (b) once commute variability is partialled out, most of the partial correlations between impedance and strain are not significant. The paper concludes with an alternative commuting-strain model which includes the new commute-variability construct.},
